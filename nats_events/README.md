# NATS Events Plugin

## Overview

Welcome to the NATS Events Plugin! This plugin is designed to facilitate event handling using NATS as the messaging system. It is currently under active development, and we are working hard to implement all the necessary features and ensure robust functionality.

## Status

**Under Construction** ðŸš§

Please note that this plugin is still in the early stages of development. The following components are yet to be implemented:

- **Inbound Transporters**: Mechanisms to receive and process incoming messages.
- **Outbound Transporters**: Mechanisms to send messages to external systems.
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation to guide users on setup, configuration, and usage.
- **Testing**: Thorough testing to ensure reliability and performance.

## Features

- **Event Handling**: Push events to NATS topics.
- **Dynamic Topic Mapping**: Map event patterns to NATS subjects (analogous to topics in other systems systems like Kafka) using templates.
- **Metadata Enrichment**: Add metadata to events before publishing.
